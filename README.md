## Features

- **Bonding Curve Launch**: Tokens launch with a bonding curve mechanism that gradually increases price as tokens are bought
- **Automatic Graduation**: Tokens automatically graduate to PancakeSwap when they reach a certain threshold
- **Tax System**: Configurable buy/sell taxes with automatic distribution to creators, treasury, and AIGC vault
- **Anti-Bot Protection**: Built-in bot protection mechanisms and blacklist functionality
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Deployable on any EVM-compatible network
- **Gas-Efficient Design**: Optimized for BNB Chain's low gas costs
- **Upgradeable Contracts**: All core contracts use OpenZeppelin's upgradeable proxy pattern
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Secure permission system for different contract functions
- **Liquidity Pool Management**: Automatic creation and management of trading pairs
- **Creator Rewards**: Token creators receive a share of trading fees and bonding rewards


## Core Contracts

### LaunchpadV2
The main launchpad contract that handles token creation, bonding curve mechanics, and graduation to PancakeSwap.

### AgentTokenV2  
The BEP20 token implementation with built-in tax mechanisms, anti-bot protection, and automatic liquidity management.

### FFactoryV2
Factory contract for creating token pairs and managing the bonding curve pairs.

### FRouter
Router contract that handles buy/sell operations on the bonding curve and manages graduation to PancakeSwap.

### TaxManager
Manages tax collection and distribution to creators, treasury, and AIGC vault.

## Architecture

The platform uses a bonding curve mechanism where:
1. Tokens are launched with an initial supply and bonding curve
2. Users can buy tokens at increasing prices as the curve progresses
3. When the bonding curve reaches a threshold, tokens automatically graduate to PancakeSwap
4. Trading fees are collected and distributed according to configured parameters

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, fill in all the variables.

3. Deploy contracts:
```bash
# For BNB
npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy_bsc.ts --network bsc

# For BNB Testnet
npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy_bsc.ts --network bsc_testnet
```

4. Verify contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat verify {contract address} --network bsc_testnet
```

## Security Features

- **Reentrancy Protection**: All external calls are protected against reentrancy attacks
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for sensitive operations
- **Upgrade Safety**: Contracts use OpenZeppelin's upgradeable proxy pattern
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs
- **Blacklist System**: Ability to blacklist malicious addresses
- **Bot Protection**: Built-in mechanisms to prevent bot manipulation
